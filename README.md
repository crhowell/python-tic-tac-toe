# Python Tic-Tac-Toe
## Basic
A slightly modified python version of:
[Rogue.rb Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/roguerb/tic-tac-toe)

## Evolved
My own, "evolved" Python version of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3

## To Play
1. Open a command-line or terminal window.
2. `cd` into the project directory
3. type `python game.py`

## Game Instructions

You will be prompted with a console "game board". That looks similar to this:

```
---------- 

  |  |  
  |  |  
  |  |  

---------- 
 
Available Moves: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
x > 
```

You place your move by typing a number and pressing enter.
If you enter a spot that has already been taken you will be re-prompted.

The numbers match up to the board  in this order.

```
---------- 

 1 | 2 | 3 
 4 | 5 | 6 
 7 | 8 | 9 

---------- 

```
